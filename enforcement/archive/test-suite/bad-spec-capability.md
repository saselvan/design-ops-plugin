# Project Spec: Real-Time Streaming Dashboard

**Project**: Kafka-based Real-Time Analytics Platform
**Author**: Test Spec (Capability Violations)
**Purpose**: This spec will FAIL validation with capability boundary violations
**Domain**: skill-gap-transcendence.md

---

## Overview

We need to build a real-time streaming analytics dashboard using technologies
the team has never worked with before. This is for our Immersion Day demo.

---

## Requirements

### Technology Stack

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 37: Skill Gaps Force Explicit Learning Budget -->
<!-- New technology without learning time budgeted -->

This project will use new technology that the team is unfamiliar with:
- Apache Kafka for streaming (first time using it)
- React with Redux for frontend (team knows Angular)
- Kubernetes for deployment (we've only used Docker)

We'll learn these as we go during the implementation phase.
The team will figure it out - we're fast learners.

### Getting Help

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 38: Support Structure Must Be Pre-Defined -->
<!-- No support structure for skill gaps -->

If anyone gets stuck on the unknown technologies, ask for help.
We'll figure it out as problems come up.
Google and Stack Overflow should have the answers we need.

### Demo Day Presentation

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 39: Demos Require Triple-Backup Protocol -->
<!-- Demo without fallback protocol -->

For the Immersion Day presentation on March 15, we'll demo the live system.
The demo will show real-time data flowing through the Kafka pipeline.
We'll present at the conference and show all the features working.

### Project Intensity

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 40: Health Signals Trigger Scope Adjustment -->
<!-- High-pressure project without health protocol -->

This is a high-pressure, intense project with tight deadlines.
The team may need to work overtime and crunch to hit the deadline.
We'll push through the stress to deliver on time.

### Timeline

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 41: Fixed Deadlines Require Tiered Scope -->
<!-- Fixed deadline without scope tiers -->

**Deadline: March 15 (Immersion Day) - FIXED, NON-NEGOTIABLE**

We must complete by this due date:
- Full Kafka pipeline
- React dashboard with all charts
- Kubernetes deployment
- Documentation

All features must be ready for the demo.

### Learning Approach

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 42: Learning Time Is First-Class Work -->
<!-- Learning not scheduled as explicit work -->

Team members should learn Kafka, React, and Kubernetes on their own time.
We expect everyone to ramp up quickly and onboard themselves.
Study the documentation and figure it out before the standup.
Learning shouldn't slow down the actual building work.

### Project Exploration

<!-- VIOLATES INVARIANT 43: Discovery Phase Required for Unknowns -->
<!-- Unknown territory without discovery phase -->

We're entering new domain territory with streaming architecture.
Let's explore the unknown requirements as we build.
We need to estimate the full project now before starting.
Commit to the timeline upfront so stakeholders have certainty.
