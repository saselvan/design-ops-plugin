## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Current self-managed PostgreSQL cluster on EC2 experiences 4 hours/month unplanned downtime. Vertical scaling ceiling reached at db.r5.4xlarge. DBA time spent on maintenance: 20 hours/week. Read replica lag during peak: 15 seconds.

### 1.2 Solution Summary

Migrate primary transactional database from self-managed PostgreSQL 14 to Aurora PostgreSQL 15. Implement read replicas in 2 regions. Zero-downtime migration using AWS DMS with validation checkpoints.

### 1.3 Scope Boundaries

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Primary OLTP database (2.3TB) | Analytics data warehouse |
| 3 read replicas | Cross-account replication |
| Application connection string update | Application code changes |
| 90-day parallel run | Archive data migration |

### 1.4 Key Stakeholders

| Role | Name | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| DBA Lead | Chen Wei | Migration execution, validation |
| Platform Lead | Alex Kim | Infrastructure, networking |
| App Team Lead | Jordan Smith | Connection testing, cutover coordination |
| SRE Lead | Sam Patel | Monitoring, incident response |

---

## 2. Success Criteria

### 2.1 Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Unplanned downtime | 4 hrs/month | <15 min/month | CloudWatch + PagerDuty |
| Read replica lag | 15s peak | <1s p99 | Aurora metrics |
| DBA maintenance time | 20 hrs/week | <5 hrs/week | Time tracking |
| Query latency (p99) | 45ms | <30ms | APM traces |

### 2.2 Success Conditions

```
SUCCESS := ALL(
  data_integrity_verified,
  zero_data_loss,
  latency_p99 < 30ms for 14_consecutive_days,
  old_cluster_decommissioned,
  cost_within_budget
)
```

### 2.3 Failure Conditions

```
FAILURE := ANY(
  data_loss_detected,
  replication_lag > 60s for 5_minutes,
  application_errors > baseline + 5%
)
```

## 3. Timeline with Validation Gates

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

**Duration**: 1 week
**Owner**: Alex Kim

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Aurora cluster provisioned (db.r6g.2xlarge)
- [ ] VPC peering configured
- [ ] Security groups updated
- [ ] Parameter groups configured (matching current)
- [ ] Read replicas in us-east-1 and us-west-2

#### Validation Gate 1: Infrastructure Ready

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Connectivity | App servers can reach Aurora | telnet test from all app hosts |
| Parameters | Match production PG config | pg_settings comparison |
| Networking | <1ms latency app→db | ping test |
| Security | Only authorized access | Security group audit |

```
GATE_1_PASS := connectivity AND params_match AND latency < 1ms AND security_verified
```

**If gate fails**: Fix networking/security issues. Do not proceed until app connectivity confirmed.

---

### Phase 2: DMS Replication

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Chen Wei

**Depends on**: Gate 1 passed

#### Deliverables
- [ ] DMS replication instance provisioned
- [ ] Source endpoint configured
- [ ] Target endpoint configured
- [ ] Full load completed
- [ ] CDC (change data capture) active
- [ ] Replication lag <10 seconds sustained

#### State Transitions (Phase 2)

<!-- Invariant #2: State Must Be Explicit -->

```
REPLICATION_STATE:
  NOT_STARTED → FULL_LOAD_RUNNING  [on: dms_task_started]
  FULL_LOAD_RUNNING → FULL_LOAD_COMPLETE  [on: initial_load_done]
  FULL_LOAD_COMPLETE → CDC_ACTIVE  [on: cdc_streaming]
  CDC_ACTIVE → CDC_CAUGHT_UP  [on: lag < 10s for 1_hour]

  * → REPLICATION_FAILED  [on: dms_error OR lag > 60s]
  REPLICATION_FAILED → CDC_ACTIVE  [on: error_resolved AND task_resumed]
```

#### Validation Gate 2: Replication Stable

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Full load complete | 100% tables loaded | DMS console |
| Row counts match | Source = Target ±0 | Count comparison script |
| CDC lag | <10s for 24 hours | CloudWatch metrics |
| No DMS errors | Zero errors in 24h | DMS logs |

```
GATE_2_PASS := tables_loaded AND rows_match AND cdc_lag < 10s AND no_errors_24h
```

**If gate fails**: Investigate DMS issues, check network bandwidth, verify no schema conflicts.

#### Data Validation Queries

```sql
-- Run on both source and target, compare results
-- Gate 2 requires: source_count = target_count for all tables

SELECT schemaname, tablename, n_live_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

-- Checksum validation for critical tables
SELECT md5(array_agg(md5(row::text))::text)
FROM (SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id) row;
```

---

### Phase 3: Application Cutover (Staged)

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Jordan Smith

**Depends on**: Gate 2 passed

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Connection string abstraction (if not exists)
- [ ] Read traffic to Aurora: 10% → 50% → 100%
- [ ] Write traffic to Aurora: shadow writes → primary
- [ ] Old cluster demoted to read-only backup

#### Cutover State Machine

```
CUTOVER_STATE:
  SOURCE_PRIMARY → READS_10PCT_AURORA  [on: feature_flag_enabled]
  READS_10PCT_AURORA → READS_50PCT_AURORA  [on: 24h_stable]
  READS_50PCT_AURORA → READS_100PCT_AURORA  [on: 48h_stable]

  READS_100PCT_AURORA → SHADOW_WRITES  [on: 72h_stable]
  SHADOW_WRITES → WRITES_TO_AURORA  [on: shadow_validation_passed]
  WRITES_TO_AURORA → SOURCE_READ_ONLY  [on: 24h_stable]
  SOURCE_READ_ONLY → CUTOVER_COMPLETE  [on: 7_days_stable]

  * → ROLLBACK  [on: error_threshold_exceeded]
  ROLLBACK → SOURCE_PRIMARY  [immediately]
```

#### Validation Gate 3: Cutover Stable

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Read latency | p99 <30ms | APM dashboard |
| Write latency | p99 <20ms | APM dashboard |
| Error rate | <0.1% | Application logs |
| Data consistency | Checksums match (shadow period) | Validation script |
| App health | All services green | Health checks |

```
GATE_3_PASS := latency_targets_met AND error_rate < 0.001 AND data_consistent
```

**If gate fails**: Rollback to source. Analyze latency/error spikes. Do not decommission source.

#### Rollback Procedure

<!-- Invariant #4: No Irreversible Without Recovery -->

```
ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE:
  1. Disable Aurora writes (feature flag) [immediate]
  2. Wait for in-flight transactions [max 30s]
  3. Enable source writes [immediate]
  4. Redirect read traffic to source [gradual, 1h]
  5. Pause DMS replication [after traffic stable]
  6. Investigate root cause [within 24h]
  7. Decide: retry or abort migration [stakeholder decision]

ROLLBACK_WINDOW: 90 days (until source decommissioned)
```

---

### Phase 4: Decommission

**Duration**: 1 week (after 90-day parallel run)
**Owner**: Chen Wei

**Depends on**: Gate 3 passed, 90 days stable

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Final data validation
- [ ] Source database snapshot (archive)
- [ ] DMS task stopped
- [ ] Source cluster terminated
- [ ] DNS records updated
- [ ] Documentation updated

#### Final Validation Gate

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 90-day stability | No rollbacks needed | Incident history |
| Final validation | Checksums match | Validation script |
| Snapshot created | Archived to S3 | S3 console |
| No source connections | 0 active connections | pg_stat_activity |

```
PROJECT_COMPLETE := stable_90_days AND final_validation AND snapshot_archived
```

## 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 4.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Data loss during cutover | Low | Critical | Shadow writes + validation | Chen |
| Replication lag spike | Medium | High | Dedicated DMS instance, monitoring | Chen |
| Application compatibility | Low | High | Extensive testing, staged rollout | Jordan |
| Cost overrun (parallel run) | Medium | Medium | 90-day cap, monitoring | Alex |
| Schema drift during migration | Low | Medium | Schema change freeze | Chen |

### 4.2 Fallback Strategies

```
IF replication_lag > 60s:
  THEN pause_cutover AND scale_dms_instance

IF application_errors > baseline + 5%:
  THEN rollback_to_source immediately

IF aurora_performance_degraded:
  THEN scale_aurora_instance (auto-scaling enabled)

IF dms_task_failed:
  THEN restart_from_checkpoint (full reload if necessary)
```

### 4.3 Circuit Breakers

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Replication lag | >60s for 5 min | Alert + pause cutover |
| Aurora CPU | >80% for 10 min | Scale up instance |
| Application errors | >1% for 5 min | Rollback to source |
| DMS errors | Any error | Alert + investigate |
