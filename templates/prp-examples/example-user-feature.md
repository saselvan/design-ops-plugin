## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

App Store reviews mention eye strain in 23% of 1-2 star ratings. Support tickets for "too bright at night" increased 340% after iOS dark mode adoption. Competitor apps all support dark mode. Current NPS for nighttime users: 32 (vs 58 for daytime users).

### 1.2 Solution Summary

Implement system-aware dark mode with manual override. Support automatic switching based on time or system setting. Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance across all screens.

### 1.3 Scope Boundaries

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Dark color palette for all 47 screens | Custom theme colors |
| System preference detection | Scheduled dark mode times |
| Manual toggle in settings | Per-screen theme override |
| Smooth transition animation | OLED true black mode (Phase 2) |

### 1.4 Key Stakeholders

| Role | Name | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| Product Manager | Lisa Park | Requirements, user research |
| Design Lead | Marcus Chen | Color system, accessibility |
| iOS Lead | Raj Patel | Implementation |
| Android Lead | Emma Wilson | Implementation |

## 2. Success Criteria

### 2.1 Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| NPS (nighttime users) | 32 | >50 | In-app survey, 7pm-7am |
| "Eye strain" review mentions | 23% of negative | <5% | Review sentiment analysis |
| Dark mode adoption | 0% | >40% | Analytics toggle tracking |
| Accessibility compliance | Partial | WCAG AA | Automated contrast checker |

### 2.2 Success Conditions

```
SUCCESS := ALL(
  nighttime_nps > 50 after 30_days,
  dark_mode_adoption > 0.4 after 30_days,
  wcag_aa_compliance = 100%,
  no_p1_bugs after 14_days
)
```

### 2.3 Failure Conditions

```
FAILURE := ANY(
  accessibility_regression_detected,
  crash_rate_increase > 1%,
  negative_review_spike > 20%
)
```

## 3. Timeline with Validation Gates

### Phase 1: Design System

**Duration**: 1.5 weeks
**Owner**: Marcus Chen

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Dark color palette defined
- [ ] All 47 screens mocked in dark mode
- [ ] Component library updated
- [ ] Contrast ratios documented
- [ ] Design handoff complete

#### Validation Gate 1: Design Approval

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Contrast compliance | All text >4.5:1, large text >3:1 | Stark plugin scan |
| Brand alignment | Approved by brand team | Sign-off email |
| Completeness | All 47 screens covered | Figma checklist |
| User feedback | >70% positive in 5-user test | Usability session |

```
GATE_1_PASS := contrast_compliant AND brand_approved AND user_positive > 0.7
```

**If gate fails**: Iterate on specific screens. Schedule additional user sessions.

#### User Emotion Mapping

<!-- Invariant #11: User Emotion Must Map to Affordance -->

| Intended Emotion | Triggering Affordance | Verification |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Relief (reduced eye strain) | Muted background colors, reduced brightness | User reports "easier on eyes" in testing |
| Control (customization) | Prominent toggle, clear system/manual options | Users find toggle within 5 seconds |
| Confidence (consistent) | Same information hierarchy in both modes | Task completion rate unchanged |

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Raj Patel (iOS), Emma Wilson (Android)

**Depends on**: Gate 1 passed

#### Deliverables
- [ ] iOS dark mode implementation
- [ ] Android dark mode implementation
- [ ] System preference detection
- [ ] Settings toggle UI
- [ ] Transition animations
- [ ] Unit tests (>85% coverage)

#### Validation Gate 2: Engineering Complete

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Test coverage | >85% | CI coverage report |
| Performance | No frame drops during transition | Performance profiler |
| Battery impact | <3% additional drain | 24-hour battery test |
| Crash-free | 99.9% crash-free sessions | Firebase Crashlytics |
| Platform parity | Feature-identical iOS/Android | QA comparison matrix |

```
GATE_2_PASS := coverage > 0.85 AND crash_free > 0.999 AND platforms_match
```

**If gate fails**: Fix failing tests, address performance issues. Do not proceed to rollout.

#### Friction Quantification

<!-- Invariant #12: Behavioral Friction Must Be Quantified -->

| Action | Maximum Friction | Measurement |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Find dark mode toggle | <5 seconds from settings entry | User testing stopwatch |
| Switch modes | <300ms transition | Animation profiler |
| Understand current state | Immediate (icon indicates mode) | User comprehension test |

---

### Phase 3: Staged Rollout

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Lisa Park

**Depends on**: Gate 2 passed

#### Deliverables
- [ ] 5% rollout with monitoring
- [ ] 25% rollout with feedback collection
- [ ] 100% rollout
- [ ] App Store/Play Store update

#### Validation Gate 3: Rollout Metrics

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Crash rate at 5% | <0.1% increase | Crashlytics |
| Adoption at 25% | >30% enable dark mode | Analytics |
| Support tickets | No increase in theme-related | Zendesk filter |
| NPS (dark mode users) | >45 | In-app survey |

```
GATE_3_PASS := crash_stable AND adoption > 0.3 AND nps > 45
```

#### Rollout Decision Points

```
AT 5% users:
  IF crash_rate_increase > 0.5%: rollback
  IF no_issues for 48h: proceed to 25%

AT 25% users:
  IF negative_feedback_spike: pause, investigate
  IF metrics_stable for 72h: proceed to 100%

AT 100% users:
  IF all_green for 7_days: close project
```

### Phase 4: Verification

**Duration**: 1 week (monitoring)
**Owner**: Lisa Park

**Depends on**: Gate 3 passed, 100% rollout stable

#### Final Validation Gate

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| NPS improvement | Nighttime NPS >50 | Survey analysis |
| Review sentiment | "Eye strain" <5% of negative | Sentiment analysis |
| Adoption sustained | >40% using dark mode | Analytics |
| Zero P1 bugs | No critical issues | Bug tracker |

```
PROJECT_COMPLETE := nps_improved AND sentiment_improved AND adoption_sustained
```

## 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 4.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Contrast issues missed | Medium | High | Automated scanning + manual review | Marcus |
| Animation performance | Low | Medium | Test on low-end devices | Raj/Emma |
| User confusion (toggle) | Low | Low | Clear iconography, onboarding tooltip | Lisa |
| Brand color conflicts | Medium | Medium | Early brand team involvement | Marcus |

### 4.2 Fallback Strategies

```
IF crash_rate_spike after rollout:
  THEN feature_flag_disable within 1_hour

IF accessibility_regression:
  THEN rollback + immediate fix priority

IF user_complaints_spike:
  THEN pause_rollout + user_research
```

### 4.3 Circuit Breakers

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Crash rate increase | >0.5% | Disable feature flag |
| Negative reviews (dark mode) | >10 in 24h | Alert product team |
| Support tickets (display issues) | >20 in 24h | Pause rollout |
