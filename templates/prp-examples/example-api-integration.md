## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Current payment processing through legacy PaymentCo has 3.2% transaction failure rate and 4-second average latency. Customers abandon checkout at 18% higher rate when payment processing exceeds 2 seconds. PaymentCo contract expires March 2026.

### 1.2 Solution Summary

Integrate Stripe as primary payment processor for all US transactions. Maintain PaymentCo as fallback for 90-day transition period. Target: <1% failure rate, <800ms p95 latency.

### 1.3 Scope Boundaries

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| US credit/debit card processing | International payments (Phase 2) |
| Stripe Checkout integration | Apple Pay / Google Pay (Phase 2) |
| Webhook handling for payment events | Subscription billing |
| PaymentCo fallback during transition | Refund automation |

### 1.4 Key Stakeholders

| Role | Name | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| Tech Lead | Sarah Chen | Architecture decisions, code review |
| Product Owner | Mike Torres | Requirements, acceptance criteria |
| Security Lead | Priya Sharma | PCI compliance review |
| Finance | James Wu | Reconciliation requirements |

---

## 2. Success Criteria

### 2.1 Primary Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Transaction failure rate | 3.2% | <1.0% | Stripe dashboard + internal logs |
| Payment latency (p95) | 4000ms | <800ms | APM traces (Datadog) |
| Checkout abandonment (payment step) | 12% | <8% | Analytics funnel |
| PCI compliance score | N/A | 100% | Quarterly audit |

### 2.2 Success Conditions

```
SUCCESS := ALL(
  failure_rate < 0.01 for 7_consecutive_days,
  p95_latency < 800ms for 7_consecutive_days,
  zero_pci_violations,
  paymentco_fully_decommissioned
)
```

### 2.3 Failure Conditions

```
FAILURE := ANY(
  failure_rate > 5% for 1_hour,
  data_breach_detected,
  pci_audit_failed
)
```

## 3. Timeline with Validation Gates

### Phase 1: Integration Development

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Sarah Chen

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Stripe SDK integrated in payment service
- [ ] Payment intent creation endpoint
- [ ] Webhook handler for payment events
- [ ] Unit tests with 90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests against Stripe test mode

#### Validation Gate 1

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| All tests pass | 100% green | CI pipeline |
| Code coverage | >90% | Jest coverage report |
| Security review | No critical findings | Security team sign-off |
| API contract | Matches Stripe docs | Contract tests |

```
GATE_1_PASS := tests_passing AND coverage > 0.9 AND security_approved
```

**If gate fails**: Fix identified issues, re-run validation. Do not proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Staged Rollout

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Owner**: Sarah Chen

**Depends on**: Gate 1 passed

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Feature flag for Stripe routing
- [ ] 1% traffic routing to Stripe
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Runbook for rollback
- [ ] 10% → 50% → 100% rollout completed

#### Validation Gate 2

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Error rate at 1% | <2% failures | Datadog dashboard |
| Error rate at 10% | <1.5% failures | Datadog dashboard |
| Error rate at 50% | <1% failures | Datadog dashboard |
| Latency at 50% | p95 <800ms | APM traces |
| No data issues | Zero reconciliation errors | Finance report |

```
GATE_2_PASS := error_rate < 0.01 AND p95 < 800 AND reconciliation_clean
```

**If gate fails**: Rollback to PaymentCo. Investigate root cause. Do not proceed to Phase 3.

#### Rollout Decision Points

```
AT 1% traffic:
  IF error_rate > 0.05: rollback immediately
  IF error_rate < 0.02 for 24h: proceed to 10%

AT 10% traffic:
  IF error_rate > 0.02: rollback to 1%
  IF error_rate < 0.015 for 48h: proceed to 50%

AT 50% traffic:
  IF error_rate > 0.015: rollback to 10%
  IF error_rate < 0.01 for 72h: proceed to 100%
```

---

### Phase 3: PaymentCo Decommission

**Duration**: 1 week
**Owner**: Mike Torres

**Depends on**: Gate 2 passed, 100% Stripe for 7 days

#### Deliverables
- [ ] PaymentCo integration code removed
- [ ] PaymentCo credentials rotated/revoked
- [ ] Final reconciliation completed
- [ ] Contract termination confirmed

#### Final Validation Gate

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 7-day metrics | All targets met | Dashboard review |
| No PaymentCo traffic | 0 requests | Logs audit |
| Clean codebase | No PaymentCo references | Code search |
| Finance sign-off | Reconciliation complete | Written confirmation |

```
PROJECT_COMPLETE := metrics_sustained AND paymentco_removed AND finance_approved
```

## 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 4.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Stripe API outage | Low | High | PaymentCo fallback active | Sarah |
| Higher than expected fees | Medium | Medium | Fee cap in contract, monitoring | James |
| Webhook delivery failures | Medium | Medium | Idempotent handlers, retry queue | Sarah |
| PCI compliance gap | Low | Critical | Early security review, Stripe hosted fields | Priya |

### 4.2 Fallback Strategies

```
IF stripe_error_rate > 0.05 for 5_minutes:
  THEN route_to_paymentco until stripe_healthy

IF stripe_latency_p95 > 2000ms for 5_minutes:
  THEN route_to_paymentco until stripe_healthy

IF rollout_metrics_degraded:
  THEN rollback_to_previous_percentage immediately
```

### 4.3 Circuit Breakers

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Stripe 5xx errors | >10 in 1 minute | Open circuit, route to PaymentCo |
| Stripe timeout | >5 in 1 minute | Open circuit for 30s |
| Daily transaction volume | >$500K | Alert finance, continue processing |
