# Design Ops v2.2

The production gold standard for AI-assisted system design. Transforms human intent into validated, executable specifications and PRPs through automated invariant enforcement.

**Version**: 2.2 | **Status**: Production Gold Standard | **License**: MIT

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to design-ops?** See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** for the 5-minute setup guide.

**Two ways to use design-ops:**

1. **Orchestrator** (standalone CLI) - Run validation loops with Claude Code
   - 📖 [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) - Installation & usage
   - 📖 [enforcement/ORCHESTRATORS.md](enforcement/ORCHESTRATORS.md) - Full documentation

2. **Skill** (integrated with Claude Code) - Use `/design` commands
   - See installation below

---

## Installation (Skill Mode)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saselvan/design-ops-plugin.git ~/tools/design-ops
cd ~/tools/design-ops
```

### 2. Make scripts executable

```bash
chmod +x enforcement/*.sh tools/*.sh
```

### 3. Verify installation

```bash
cd test-integration && ./real-project-test.sh
# Should show: ✅ ALL INTEGRATION TESTS PASSED! (18/18)
```

### 4. Add to Claude Code

**Option A: Project-level** (recommended)

Create `.claude/settings.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "skills": ["~/tools/design-ops/design.md"]
}
```

**Option B: Reference in CLAUDE.md**

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Skills
- ~/tools/design-ops/design.md
```

### 5. Use it

```bash
claude
> /design validate specs/my-feature.md
> /design prp specs/my-feature.md
```

## What is Design Ops?

Design Ops is a comprehensive methodology for designing and implementing software:

1. **Research-driven**: Cross-domain inspiration, deep domain analysis
2. **Validation-heavy**: 43 invariants catch issues at spec-time, not production
3. **Emotionally-aware**: Captures user emotional arcs, not just functional flows
4. **AI-optimized**: Generates AI-executable PRPs from validated specs
5. **Learning-enabled**: Retrospectives improve the system over time

---

## v2.2 Current: Production Gold Standard

Design Ops v2.2 (January 2026) is the definitive specification system for AI-assisted development:

| Core Capability | Benefit |
|-----------------|---------|
| **43 Invariant Validation** | Catches ambiguity, incompleteness, and design errors before code |
| **11-Step Validated Pipeline** | Stress-test → Validate → Generate → Check → Implement → Test → Deploy |
| **PRP Compilation** | Transforms specs into AI-executable Product Requirements Prompts |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Quantitative risk assessment (1-10) gates implementation |
| **Multi-Domain Support** | Universal + 6 domain-specific invariant sets |
| **Continuous Validation** | Watch-mode real-time spec health monitoring |
| **Learning Loops** | Retrospectives improve system over time |

---

## Quick Start (v2.2)

**Follow the 11-step pipeline. Skip nothing.** Each step catches different problems:

### The Pipeline (in order)

```bash
/design spec journey.md               # 0. Create spec from journey
/design stress-test specs/feature.md  # 1. Check completeness
/design validate specs/feature.md     # 2. Check clarity
/design prp specs/feature.md          # 3. Compile to PRP
/design check PRPs/feature-prp.md     # 4. Verify PRP quality
/design implement PRPs/feature-prp.md # 5. Generate tests (TDD)
/design test-validate test_*.py       # 6. Validate test suite
/design test-cohesion tests/          # 7. Check test interactions
/design ralph-check PRPs/feature-prp.md # 8. Verify PRP compliance
/design run PRPs/feature-prp.md       # 9. AI implements to spec
# 10. Retrospective (learning loop)
```

**Why this order?** Specs generate structure. Stress-test finds incompleteness. Validate finds ambiguity. All must pass before PRP generation.

See [QUICKSTART.md](enforcement/QUICKSTART.md) for the complete 5-minute guide.

## Why v2.2 is Production Gold Standard

**Invariant-Enforced Design**: 43 domain-aware invariants catch design issues at spec-time, before implementation. Not suggestions—hard gates.

**Validated Pipeline**: The 11-step workflow is non-negotiable. Each step enforces different constraints:
- Steps 0-2: Spec completeness and clarity
- Step 3: PRP compilation
- Step 4: Quality assurance
- Steps 5-8: Test-driven implementation prep
- Steps 9-10: AI implementation + learning

**Multi-Agent Architecture**: Spec-analyst, validator, conventions-checker, PRP-generator, and reviewer agents run in parallel, each with specific expertise.

**Confidence-Gated Implementation**: Quantitative risk assessment (1-10) prevents overconfident decisions. A 6/10 spec doesn't get built without explicit acknowledgment.

**Codebase Integration**: Automatic CONVENTIONS.md extraction ensures implementations match project patterns.

## Key Features

### 1. Spec Validation (43 Invariants)

Catches ambiguity before it causes problems:

```bash
/design validate specs/S-001-feature.md

❌ VIOLATION: Invariant #1 (Ambiguity is Invalid)
   Line 12: "process data properly"
   → Fix: Replace 'properly' with objective criteria
```

### 2. Confidence Scoring

Quantitative risk assessment before implementation:

```
Confidence Score: 8/10
  ✅ Requirement clarity: 9/10
  ✅ Pattern availability: 9/10
  ⚠️  Edge cases: 6/10

Risk: Third-party API behavior uncertain
```

### 3. PRP Generation

Transform specs into AI-executable blueprints:

```bash
/design prp specs/S-001-feature.md

📊 PRP generated: PRPs/feature-prp.md
   Confidence: 8/10
   Quality score: 95/100
```

### 4. Implementation Review

Verify code matches design:

```bash
/design review specs/S-001-feature.md src/feature/

✅ Requirements: 11/12 implemented (92%)
✅ Tests: 87% coverage
⚠️  2 convention violations
```

## Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Invariants from pain, not theory**: Every invariant comes from a real failure
2. **Rejection over correction**: System rejects bad specs, doesn't fix them
3. **Validation before implementation**: Catch issues at spec-time
4. **Learning loops**: Retrospectives improve the system (spec-delta)
5. **Appropriate rigor**: Full/Standard/Quick modes

### Why This Approach Works

- Cross-domain research finds solutions others miss
- Emotional design creates better user experiences
- Multiple validation gates catch compound errors
- AI-executable PRPs enable reliable implementation
- Confidence scoring provides early risk warnings
