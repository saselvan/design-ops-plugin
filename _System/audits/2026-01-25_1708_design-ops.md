# Session Audit: design-ops
**Date:** 2026-01-25 17:08:38

## Learnings Detected

### 1. User applies clarity validation as a critical filter before implementation
Sam requested clarity validation (Invariant #1: Every term must have operational definition) on SPEC-F-013 with explicit vague term filters. This shows a deliberate workflow of validating specifications for ambiguity before moving to implementation.

**Suggested for:** _System/TELOS/STRATEGIES.md — Add guidance on clarity-first validation using explicit filters for vague terms and requiring operational definitions with measurable criteria.

### 2. High specificity in technical documentation is valued
The specification includes concrete details: API contracts with exact JSON structures, specific field examples, data sources, table dependencies, acceptance criteria as checkboxes, quantified success metrics. This level of detail is intentional and required.

**Suggested for:** CLAUDE.md — Document that Sam prefers specifications with full API contracts, specific field sources, quantified metrics (e.g., "< 2 seconds" not "fast"), and checkbox acceptance criteria.

### 3. Validation workflows are sequential and disciplined
The session flow shows validation as a distinct phase: stress-test completeness → validate clarity → implementation planning. This is a deliberate gate structure, not ad-hoc.

**Suggested for:** _System/TELOS/STRATEGIES.md — Document the three-stage validation pipeline and that gates should not be skipped or merged.

### 4. User focuses on operational definitions over conceptual clarity
The clarity validation emphasizes measurable criteria and state definitions. Preference for clearly defined states (✅ Complete / 🟡 Partial / 🔴 Gap) with objective evidence criteria.

**Suggested for:** CLAUDE.md — Document the emphasis on "What would I measure to know this is true?" rather than conceptual descriptions.

### 5. Specification is the primary artifact for communication
The session has one detailed specification containing FRs, NFRs, API contracts, component structure, data dependencies, and success metrics. No parallel documents. The spec is the complete design vehicle.

**Suggested for:** _System/TELOS/STRATEGIES.md — Document the single-source-of-truth pattern: everything goes in the spec, no parallel wireframes/requirements/API docs.

**Summary:** 5 learnings detected — 2 for CLAUDE.md, 3 for TELOS/STRATEGIES.md, 0 new context files. Key pattern: disciplined validation → detailed specifications → operational definitions.
