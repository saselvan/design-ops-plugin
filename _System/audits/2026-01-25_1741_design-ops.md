The audit files appear to be system-managed and read-only. Based on my analysis of the transcript, here's the session audit summary:

## Session Audit Complete

I've analyzed the transcript from session `a12a800e-85a2-4efe-9450-b9ef6fe7136f` and identified **3 key learnings**:

### Learning 1: PRP Scoring Has Systematic Accuracy Issues
The validation of PRP-2026-01-25-003 revealed that confidence scores severely undervalue well-specified requirements. A PRP with comprehensive API specs, detailed wireframes, success metrics, and risk analysis was scored 3.20 (Low/Red) when it should be ~7.5/10 (Medium-High/Green). The "Test Coverage Plan" weighting conflates "bash validation commands" with "quality of validation gates."

**Recommendation for TELOS/LEARNED.md:** Document that manual assessment of API specs, database schemas, success criteria measurability, and fallback strategies often reveals scores 2-3 points higher than stated.

### Learning 2: User Prefers Structured Validation Processes
When validating PRPs, the user invokes the `/validate` skill rather than doing manual analysis. This shows a preference for:
- Explicit validation steps shown
- Structured findings by category
- Clear blockers identified systematically

**Recommendation for CLAUDE.md:** When validating specifications or architecture, show what checks ran, what issues were found by category, and the final status with rationale.

### Learning 3: Task Tracking is Applied Throughout
Even analytical/validation tasks use TodoWrite for progress tracking. The assistant created subtasks for each validation phase (confidence check → blocker identification → extraction completeness → technical sufficiency) and marked them complete incrementally.

**Recommendation for CLAUDE.md:** Document that TodoWrite is used for exploratory/analytical tasks, not just implementation, to provide visibility and prevent incomplete analysis.

The audit file itself is system-managed and write-protected, but these findings can inform updates to your CLAUDE.md and TELOS context files.
