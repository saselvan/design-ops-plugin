Session audit complete. Here's the summary:

## Session Audit: design-ops (2026-01-23 03:05:24)

### 9 Learnings Detected

| # | Learning | Suggested Location |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **ADHD accommodation** - needs minimal interruption workflows, relies on automation | CLAUDE.md |
| 2 | **Data Architect background** - complexity welcome, fluent in graph DBs/Cypher/Databricks | CLAUDE.md |
| 3 | **Late night work pattern** - 3am sessions, good at self-regulating deferrals | CLAUDE.md |
| 4 | **Mondrian aesthetic** - wants bold color blocks, delight, not dull palettes | CLAUDE.md |
| 5 | **Approval fatigue** - pre-approve action categories, don't interrupt per-step | learned-invariants.md |
| 6 | **Executable over docs** - build the artifact, not just documentation about it | learned-invariants.md |
| 7 | **SA Intel taxonomy** - needs dual focus: customer-facing + internal career work | New: SA-INTEL-TAXONOMY.md |
| 8 | **YAML parsing** - Obsidian frontmatter with colons breaks parsers | learned-invariants.md |
| 9 | **Roadmap capture** - deferred work should go to backlog, not disappear | CLAUDE.md |

### Recommended Actions
1. Create `CLAUDE.md` with user context (cognitive style, background, preferences)
2. Append INV-L003 through INV-L005 to `learned-invariants.md`
3. Create `_System/TELOS/SA-INTEL-TAXONOMY.md` for second-brain requirements
4. Consider creating a `ROADMAP.md` for deferred features

The full audit report was generated but couldn't be written due to permissions on the `_System/audits` directory. Would you like me to output the full markdown content so you can save it manually, or adjust permissions on that directory?
