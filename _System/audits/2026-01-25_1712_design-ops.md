## Session Audit: design-ops
**Date:** 2026-01-25 17:12:36

I've analyzed the session transcript and identified 10 key learnings about your design approach and workflow preferences. Here's what I found:

### **Key Learnings:**

**1. Skills as Workflow Verbs**
- You treat `/stress-test` and similar skills as primary tools, not auxiliary helpers
- Suggest adding to CLAUDE.md: Automatic skill invocation when reviewing specs

**2. Invariant-Driven QA** 
- Specifications are validated against domain invariants *before* implementation
- Violations trigger spec revision, not workarounds
- Add to STRATEGIES.md

**3. Progressive Disclosure Pattern**
- Complex information structured as BLUF → Defend → Deep Detail (Levels 1.5 → 2 → 3)
- Cognitive load management is intentional design principle
- Add to STRATEGIES.md

**4. SFDC Integration Philosophy**
- Clear ownership boundaries: avoid duplicating data, instead surface *what to change* in SFDC
- UI as action layer, not data duplication
- Add to LEARNED.md

**5. Stakeholder-Focused (Not User-Centric)**
- Design for the *downstream* stakeholder (manager) who will see/use the output
- Include conversation templates and talking points
- Add to CLAUDE.md

**6. Operational Definitions Requirement**
- Every subjective term must have measurable criteria (Invariant #1)
- Status badges tied to specific signal types and date ranges
- Confidence scores on all AI output
- Add to LEARNED.md

**7. Error Handling as First-Class**
- Not afterthought—fully specified with timeouts, retry logic, fallbacks
- Each scenario needs: detection, user message, recovery path
- Add to LEARNED.md

**8. Risk Management in Specs**
- Explicit Assumptions section with "Risk if Wrong" and "Mitigation"
- Active risk thinking prevents downstream surprises
- Add to STRATEGIES.md

**9. Enforcement Over Suggestion**
- Invariant violations REJECTED, not warned
- Compiler-level thinking with layer 1-4 enforcement
- Add to CLAUDE.md

**10. Spec Completeness Checklist**
- Acceptance criteria (AC-X.Y), NFR tables, data sources, component diagrams, scope boundaries, success metrics
- Multiple verification angles built in
- Add to STRATEGIES.md

### **Summary**
- **10 learnings detected**
- **4 for CLAUDE.md**: Workflow, stakeholder focus, enforcement thinking, patterns
- **6 for TELOS**: Risk management, invariant strategy, information architecture, definitions, errors, completeness patterns
- **0 new files needed**

**Key Insight:** Your approach is specification-driven and engineering-focused, not user-centric. Heavy emphasis on operational definitions, error paths, and multi-stakeholder awareness with explicit boundaries and assumptions.

Would you like me to add these learnings to your CLAUDE.md and TELOS files?
