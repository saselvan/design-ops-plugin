I've completed the session audit analysis. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Session Audit: design-ops (2026-01-23)

The transcript shows a comprehensive brainstorming session about redesigning the SA Intelligence Vault taxonomy. The user worked with Claude and Glean to design a unified entity model for both customer-facing SA work AND internal career tracking.

### Key Learnings Detected (8 total)

| # | Learning | Suggested Location |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **User has ADHD** - designs systems around executive function challenges (low-friction, auto-surfacing commitments) | CLAUDE.md |
| 2 | **Data Architect background** - comfortable with complex schemas, DDL, junction tables | CLAUDE.md |
| 3 | **Databricks SA role** - knows SA Handbook, RACI, L100-L500 levels, FE ladders | TELOS/CONTEXT.md |
| 4 | **Uses Glean alongside Claude** - Glean has Databricks internal knowledge | TELOS/STRATEGIES.md |
| 5 | **Session vs Activity pattern** - keep both (raw vs curated), many-to-many relationship | TELOS/LEARNED.md |
| 6 | **Internal career tracking needed** - not just customer work (Assets, Initiatives, Evidence chains) | TELOS/LEARNED.md |
| 7 | **Evidence scoring rubric** - Base points by outcome, modifiers for depth/RACI/stage | New reference file |
| 8 | **Topic modeling approach** - Local HuggingFace, Signals-only to start | TELOS/STRATEGIES.md |

### Recommended Actions
1. Update CLAUDE.md with ADHD context and data architect background
2. Create evidence-scoring-rubric.md with the Glean-provided scoring system
3. Document the Session vs Activity pattern and Full SA Graph in LEARNED.md
4. Consider formalizing the unified entity model as a design doc
