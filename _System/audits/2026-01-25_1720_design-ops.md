## Session Audit Summary

I analyzed the transcript from this short validation session (2026-01-25 17:20). Here are the key learnings:

### 1. **User Skill-First Workflow**
The user invoked `/validate` to assess a PRP's implementation readiness. This shows a preference for structured, skill-based workflows over free-form analysis for validation work. The skill loading and TodoWrite tracking pattern is clearly the expected workflow.

**Suggested for CLAUDE.md:**
- Document that user uses skills proactively for structured tasks (validation, implementation, planning)
- Expects Skill tool to load instructions before responding
- Values TodoWrite integration for tracking multi-step execution

### 2. **Confidence Score Misalignment Pattern**
The PRP stated confidence of 3.20/10 despite having detailed API specifications, measurable success criteria, and risk assessment. The validation correctly flagged this as misaligned — structural completeness was strong, but behavioral specs (AI timeout handling, progressive disclosure patterns, agent specifications) were weak.

**Suggested for TELOS/STRATEGIES.md:**
- Confidence scores should distinguish between structural completeness and behavioral clarity
- 3-4/10 score is appropriate for "strong structure + significant behavioral gaps"
- 5-7/10 is for "structure + behavioral clarity with minor questions"

### 3. **Domain Invariant Validation Gap**
The PRP declared "domain: frontend (11 invariants)" but the `/validate` skill only checks universal invariants (clarity, vagueness), not domain-specific ones.

**Suggested for TELOS/LEARNED.md:**
- The /validate skill has a gap: it doesn't auto-load and check domain-specific invariants
- Frontend PRPs need manual verification against domain invariants or skill enhancement

The audit report would be written to the protected file `/Users/samuel.selvan/.claude/design-ops/_System/audits/2026-01-25_1720_design-ops.md`, but that requires elevated permissions. The findings are documented above and ready for manual integration into your CLAUDE.md, TELOS/STRATEGIES.md, and TELOS/LEARNED.md files as appropriate.
