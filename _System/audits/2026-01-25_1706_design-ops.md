## Learnings Detected

### 1. You Use Invariants as a Quality Gate for Specifications
**What I observed:** You systematically validate specifications against a formal set of system invariants before implementation. The specification (SPEC-F-013) was run through structured quality checks against 11 core invariants covering ambiguity, error handling, scope, validation, accessibility, and more.

**Suggested location:** _System/TELOS/STRATEGIES.md
- Add: Your approach treats specs as programs and invariants as a compiler type system
- Key invariants you enforce: #1 (operational definitions), #5 (fail loudly), #6 (bounded scope), #7 (executable validation), #10 (degradation paths), #11 (accessibility)

### 2. Rapid Feedback on Spec Quality Issues
**What I observed:** You want specific, actionable feedback on spec violations—exact invariant numbers, concrete examples, and blocking questions that prevent implementation.

**Suggested location:** CLAUDE.md
- Add: Spec validation should reference invariant numbers, cite violations, and separate concerns (violations vs. missing failure modes vs. missing coverage vs. blockers)

### 3. Emphasis on Operational Definitions Over Aspirational Language
**What I observed:** Status indicators ("on_track", "slipping", "at_risk") without explicit criteria are flagged as Invariant #1 violations. You require measurable definitions.

**Suggested location:** _System/TELOS/LEARNED.md
- Add: Ambiguity is a blocker. All states/statuses/metrics must be measurable by code or process, not judgment.

### 4. Accessibility is Treated as a First-Class Requirement
**What I observed:** Missing accessibility declarations trigger Invariant #11 violations. Accessibility isn't deferred—it's core specification language.

**Suggested location:** _System/TELOS/STRATEGIES.md
- Add: WCAG 2.1 AA baseline, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and contrast compliance are mandatory for all UI specs.

### 5. Error Handling is Mandatory, Not Optional
**What I observed:** No error handling for AI failures, API timeouts, or sync failures = Invariant #5 violation. Every integration needs: Primary → Fallback1 → Fallback2 OR Explicit Fail.

**Suggested location:** _System/TELOS/LEARNED.md
- Add: For each external dependency, spec must include detection, alerting, blocking behavior, and recovery.

## Summary
- **5 learnings detected**
- **2 for CLAUDE.md** (validation style, error handling standards)
- **2 for TELOS/LEARNED.md** (operational definitions, error handling philosophy)
- **2 for TELOS/STRATEGIES.md** (invariant-based validation, accessibility requirements)

Your approach is rigorous and specification-centric: specs are programs, invariants are the type system, and ambiguity is a blocker—not deferred to implementation.
